# 5 Topics for Discussion (March 29th)

## Is the field of robotics advanced enough so that we can have useful debates on the moral and ethical perspective of it?
Many technological achievements such as the internet and flight have opened up debates for ethics, laws, and regulations that were not previously possible.
Most of the questions emerged after the technology has been used for some time. Is the field of robotics developed enough, so that such questions can emerge?

## Do we as humans have the right to decide what is ethical and what is not for robots?
Is there a possibility that conscious robots hold different moral and ethical values than humans? If so, is it right for us to make decisions for them?

## Should different types of robots (i.e. caregivers versus weapons) have different moral values and ethical codes?
Should robots that are designed for different behaviors be equally responsible for the same actions?

## Manipulation of the levels of consciousness..
Humans, as creators of robots and AI, will most likely have the ability to manipulate their levels of consciousness. Is it acceptable that we alter it to make the
moral values of robots easier to control?

## Manipulation of feelings towards humans..
Having consciousness means that there is a possibility of robots and AI to have their independently created perspective of humans. Is it acceptable
to manipulate their emotions and consciousness so that robots have a positive perspective on humans (even if independently their perspective would be negative)?
