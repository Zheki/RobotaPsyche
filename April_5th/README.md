# Projection

I used the method and calculations we learned in class to calculate the projection of vector v upon vector u in processing. Although I first wrote the code in a static fashion (without setup() and draw()), I wanted to make sure that everything was working properly so I made a simple vizualization uzing two lines and a circle in the draw() fucntion.

# 'I, Robot' Discussion

1. What is the reason behind the author's opinion that it is difficult for robots to be accepted by humans? During the first story the robot is labeled as "a horrible machine", which implies hatred and fear towards it by it's human owners.

2. Robots must always follow the rules. Why would a robot break the rules? Is it due to a malfunction caused by human error, or due to its own motivation?

3. If it is due to its own motivation, would that happen if its own life is in danger or do robots simly not value their own life as much as they value something else?

4. Do such selfish and strict rules cause humans to be put in danger, such as the part in which the robot enters a loop and a human has to risk its life to save it?

5. Are the laws flawed due to humans' emotional attachment to robots?
