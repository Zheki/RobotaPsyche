#Projection

I used the method and calculations we learned in class to calculate the projection of vector v upon vector u in processing. Although I first wrote the code in a static fashion (without setup() and draw()), I wanted to make sure that everything was working properly so I made a simple vizualization uzing two lines and a circle in the draw() fucntion.
