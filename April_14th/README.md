# Final Project Idea

For my final project for the course Robota Psyche, I would like to work on something related to artificial intelligence. Throughout the duration of the course I became extremely interested
in the topic of AI both from a philosphical, legal, and technical perspective. I consider machine learning or deep learning to be one of the foundations for my learing process in AI, and therefore
I will try to make a processing software that works based on one of these two methods. Additionally, the 10th and last chapter of one of my favorite readings from this course, The Nature of Code by Dan Schiffman,
explores precisely the topic of neural networks. I intend to use this chapter as an inspiration for my final project. The largest challenge that I expect to face is the difficulty of coding a machine learning algorithm,
however, with the help of the professor, and the available resources, I hope to be able to successfully complete such a challenging attempt.
