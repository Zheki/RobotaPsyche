## Introduction:

For this assignment I wanted to create a simulation of viruses evolving to attack a cell. The idea is that the program begins with some predefined number of viruses and randomly discovers a cell, which every generation attempts to attack more.

## Difficulties:

I presonally found this to be one of the most challenging attempts in coding. I came across many errors such as null pointer exceptions, syntax problems, global and local variable issues, etc. It was especially difficult dealing with vector arrays in the DNA class. I have been working on the code every day since Thursday (4 and a half days) and I managed to solve many of the issues. The learning process was long and complicated, but I definately learned a lot from this coding excercise. However, I did not manage to get the DNA class fully working, and I am very confused for why many of my attempts did not succeed, but I am extremely determined to make it work properly, and learn even more from the experience.
