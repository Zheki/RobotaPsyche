# Final Project 

As described in the proposal from April 14th, I am intending for my final project to be some sort of a machine learning algorithm on processing. For two days I will explore how the mechanics
work and I am learning which opportunities I have to create such an algorithm. I am hoping to check with the professor on the executability of this idea. (19.04.2021)
