## What Changed
For this assignment I edited the code as instructed, to return for behaviors and apply them as a separate function. This was a fairly simple process.

## DNA and evolution
This was the most challenging part for me and I still have many issues with fully implementing the feature of evolution. I created a DNA class whcih holds values such as size, health, and speed. These are supposed to be characteristics of each single vehicle (which I intend to resemble a virus). These values will be directly responsible for how likely a single vehicle is to survive. Currently I am creating a number of vehicles which move accross a field based on directions caused by perlin noise. I am intending to create objects which I will call cells. The viruses will be able to attach to these cells, and when the generation ends, only those that have attached will reproduce, the rest will die.

## Next steps
I need to find a way to make the perlin noise smooter and slightly more random (perfect values for my idea). Get the DNA class working and implement evolution based on the survival of generations.
